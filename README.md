# Football Analytics

## 1. Scraping the data

I have scraped data from two sources : 
- [understat.com](understat.com) -> I have followed this [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/slehkyi/web-scraping-football-statistics-2014-now#Scraping-data-for-all-teams-of-all-leagues-of-all-seasons) tutorial to get the data.
- [fbref.com](fbref.com) -> The code is mainly taken from this [Github](https://github.com/parth1902/Scrape-FBref-data/). I then adapted it a bit.
